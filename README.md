**WARNING: Stable Baselines3 is currently in a beta version, breaking changes may occur before 1.0 is released**

Note: most of the documentation of [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) should be still valid though.

# Stable Baselines3

Stable Baselines3 is a set of improved implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch. It is the next major version of [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines).

You can read a detailed presentation of Stable Baselines in the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@araffin/stable-baselines-a-fork-of-openai-baselines-reinforcement-learning-made-easy-df87c4b2fc82).


These algorithms will make it easier for the research community and industry to replicate, refine, and identify new ideas, and will create good baselines to build projects on top of. We expect these tools will be used as a base around which new ideas can be added, and as a tool for comparing a new approach against existing ones. We also hope that the simplicity of these tools will allow beginners to experiment with a more advanced toolset, without being buried in implementation details.

**Note: despite its simplicity of use, Stable Baselines3 (SB3) assumes you have some knowledge about Reinforcement Learning (RL).** You should not utilize this library without some practice. To that extent, we provide good resources in the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/rl.html) to get started with RL.

## Migration guide

**TODO: migration guide from Stable-Baselines in the documentation**

## Documentation

Documentation is available online: [https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/)


## RL Baselines3 Zoo: A Collection of Trained RL Agents

[RL Baselines3 Zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo). is a collection of pre-trained Reinforcement Learning agents using Stable-Baselines3.

It also provides basic scripts for training, evaluating agents, tuning hyperparameters, plotting results and recording videos.

Goals of this repository:

1. Provide a simple interface to train and enjoy RL agents
2. Benchmark the different Reinforcement Learning algorithms
3. Provide tuned hyperparameters for each environment and RL algorithm
4. Have fun with the trained agents!

Github repo: https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo

Documentation: https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/rl_zoo.html

## Installation

**Note:** Stable-Baselines3 supports PyTorch 1.4+.

### Prerequisites
Stable Baselines3 requires python 3.6+.

#### Windows 10

To install stable-baselines on Windows, please look at the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html#prerequisites).


### Install using pip
Install the Stable Baselines3 package:
```
pip install stable-baselines3[extra]
```

This includes an optional dependencies like OpenCV or `atari-py` to train on atari games. If you do not need those, you can use:
```
pip install stable-baselines3
```

Please read the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/) for more details and alternatives (from source, using docker).


## Example

Most of the library tries to follow a sklearn-like syntax for the Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

Here is a quick example of how to train and run PPO on a cartpole environment:
```python
import gym

from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.ppo import MlpPolicy

env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

obs = env.reset()
for i in range(1000):
    action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    env.render()
    if done:
      obs = env.reset()

env.close()
```

Or just train a model with a one liner if [the environment is registered in Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Environments) and if [the policy is registered](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/custom_policy.html):

```python
from stable_baselines3 import PPO

model = PPO('MlpPolicy', 'CartPole-v1').learn(10000)
```

Please read the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/) for more examples.
